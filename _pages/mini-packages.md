During my Masters studies, I made two R mini-packages to calculate some basic forest's structural and diversity attributes, and to fit linear models using the forest attributes as dependent variables and image texture as independent ones. The first one (VegCommunity) consists of a very basic approach to calculate the forest attributes. It might be a useful as a starting point for people learning R. In turn, the second one (RSModels) has several functions to easily fit all the combinations of image texture to model the desired forest attributes. Both repositories can be consulted in my github.
