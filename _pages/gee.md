I made a Google Earth Manual in Spanish, which can be consulted in the following link:

* [Cómo usar Google Earth Engine y no fallar en el intento](https://publicaciones.ciga.unam.mx/index.php/ec/catalog/book/12)

The github pages version, as well as the complete files used to build the book can be consulted in the following repository:

* [Manual de Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/JonathanVSV/GEE_manual)

I gave a Google Earth Engine Workshop along with Gabriel Perilla, organized by SELPER - México in July 2021. The videos of this workshop can be seen in the following youtube link:

I made some Google Earth Engine scripts that can be used to perform cloudless annual mosaics using Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 surface reflectance collections, or obtain the number of cloudless observations per pixel using Sentinel-2 images or both Landsat and Sentinel.
