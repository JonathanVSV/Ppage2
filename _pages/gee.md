I am currently working on a collaborative Google Earth Manual in Spanish, which can consulted in the following repository:

* [Manual de Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/JonathanVSV/GEE_manual)

I have made some Google Earth Engine scripts that can be used to perform cloudless annual mosaics using Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 surface reflectance collections, or obtain the number of cloudless observations per pixel using Sentinel-2 images.
